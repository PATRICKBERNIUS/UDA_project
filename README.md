# Song Scraping and Lyric Sentiment Analysis


This project attempts to scrape song data from public apple music
playlists, perform sentiment analysis using several different methods,
and reorder said playlist from happiest to saddest, plotting the results
and providing a dataframe of the songs in their new order. Uses Genius’s
API to extract lyrics.

``` python
import json
import re


#parsing json
data = r2.json()

#song data is nested here
song_data = data['resources']['songs']

#extracts all the names of the songs
songs_list = [song['attributes']['name'] for song in song_data.values()]
#removes parentheses and strops spaces
songs_list = [re.sub(r"\(.+\)", '', s).strip() for s in songs_list]


#extracting artist names
artist_list = [artist['attributes']['artistName'] for artist in song_data.values()]


#creating dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "song": songs_list, 
    "artist": artist_list})


#creating dictionary for searching
songs_dict = dict(zip(songs_list, artist_list))
songs_dict
```

I just wanted to be a kid and play\nTo this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats\nNever stolen, I\'m from Maryland\nWhere they shoot you in the dark of the night\nLike Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon\nCatch me rollin\' with the realest\nLyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero\nFar from a hero, bitch, I\'m De Niro in \nGoodfellas\nIf your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella\nLet me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa\nMurder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"\nYeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa\nWe don\'t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love\nWord to my homies up above, we slingin\' like drugs\nAnd overdose \'em like the dealer does (\nLogic\n)\nYeah\n\n[Break: Thalia]\nHip-hop\n\n[Chorus]\nI swear this music in my genes like Denim\nLyricism seep in \'em like venom\nYes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee my vision as I\'ve elevated and risen\nOpen your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision\nI finally made my way up out that section 8 division\nNot by busting and killing though I\'ve had my share of stealin\'\nBut by putting pen to this pad and dispersin\' these feelings\nWhile the label only care about making a killin\'\nFeel my energy—I ain\'t talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G\nThat\'s the shit they never see\nBut I own supremacy, number one—I better be\nBitch, I said, "I bet I be."\nTake my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me\nTell me, how is they gon\' remember me?\nAs the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?\nOr will they be addressing me, talking less of me\nJust \'cause I was different\nJust \'cause I was doing what I love?\nAnd the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove\n\'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it\nI just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid\nI just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it\nWorldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted\nWhile the rest of \'em just worry \'bout bitches and gettin\' blunted\nStill that same motherfucker from that \nYS1\nOnly difference: I\'m stronger and better from when I begun\nSo when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed\nThat my music is different and my vision\'s rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)\nAnd do my best to refrain\nFrom having conversations with people that ain\'t in my lane\nWill I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?\nGive the world everything I have to give\nThis is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age\nUnderstand that I\'m a man not defined by his wage\nEven though it\'s in the millions, that shit don\'t define my brilliance\nOpen your mind and maybe you can see the billions\nOf people that separated, but all equal\nTo know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nI swear this music in my genes like Denim\nLyricism seep in \'em like venom\nYes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him\nSpit it like Holy water, prophetically repent \'em\nThen we gone',

Does she know what I\'m pursuin\'?\nI ain\'t talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined\nBut sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I\'m doin\'\nThey say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth\nI should spend it all with y\'all, but I spend it in the booth\nThis is everything I love, this is everything I need\nNever sacrifice this feelin\' even though my heart it bleed\nThis is everything I love, everything I need\nNever sacrifice this feelin\' even though my heart bleed\nUnder pressure, I\'ve been feelin\' under pressure\n\n[Interlude]\nHey, son, I\'m sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years, so I couldn\'t get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren\'t able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin\' how things are going. Deb and I aren\'t together anymore, um... Livin\' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don\'t know, my sisters and your aunts that you\'ve never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin\', you know? And um, I don\'t wanna hear you joinin\' the Illuminati, \'cause then I gotta kill ya.

broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin\' I\'m in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn\'t say no\nPeople tryna say I\'m goin\' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends\' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it\'s hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin\'\nThe media said he\'s way out of control\nI just feel like I\'m the only one not pretendin\'\nI\'m not out of control, I\'m just not in their control\nI know I\'m the most influential\nThat \nTIME\n cover was just confirmation\nThis generation\'s closest thing to Einstein\nSo don\'t worry about me, I\'m fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don\'t need to question\nI know it\'s antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon\'t stare at money too long, it\'s Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn\'t supposed to make it past 25\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you\'re lookin\' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin\' whether God\'s gonna say hi\nOh, you\'re lookin\' at the church

great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin\' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin\' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (\nReal!\n)\nI\'ve been woken from enlightened man\'s dream\nCheckin\' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n\'Cause if I\'m up way too much, I\'m out of touch\nI\'m prayin\' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it\'s not just rappin\'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I\'m on Your

me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would\'ve took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it\'s the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it\'s better that I stayed at home with my folks\n\'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I\'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I\'m on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin\' for niggas like where\'s
