# Unstructured Data Analysis: Playlist Lyrics Sentiment Analysis


This project attempted to scrape song data from public apple music playlists, perform sentiment analysis using several different methods, and reorder said playlist from happiest to saddest, plotting the results and providing a dataframe of the songs in their new order. Uses Genius's API to extract lyrics.


Inlcudes: 

    - Original qmd where most of the work and expirimentation was done
    - lyrics_app.py - code for streamlit app created by Claude AI. Does not work publicly due to Genius API blocking
    - Working pipeline script that executes scraping, sentiment analysis, and reorganization on given Apple Music playlist link.
